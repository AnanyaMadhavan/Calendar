# Calendar

Calendars are tools used to organize time by dividing it into periods, typically based on the cycles of celestial bodies like the sun and the moon. They serve as reference systems for scheduling events, tracking seasons, and managing social, religious, and economic activities. Throughout history, various civilizations have developed their own calendar systems, often based on astronomical observations, religious beliefs, or cultural traditions.
